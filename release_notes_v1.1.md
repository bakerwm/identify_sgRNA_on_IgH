# sgRNA Design Pipeline v1.1 Release Notes

## Overview

Version 1.1 brings significant improvements to the sgRNA design pipeline, focusing on robustness, usability, and better visualization of results. This release enhances error handling, adds resumable execution capabilities, improves logging, and introduces new visualization features.

## New Features

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error trapping in shell scripts with detailed error messages
- **Resumable Execution**: Pipeline now intelligently skips completed steps, making it possible to resume after interruptions
- **Improved Logging**: Detailed timestamped logs for better tracking and debugging
- **Utilities Module**: New `utils.py` module with common functions for better code organization
- **Visualization Features**: Comprehensive plots of sgRNA characteristics (GC content, direction, position)
- **HTML Reports**: Beautiful HTML reports with embedded visualizations
- **Dependency Checking**: Automatic validation of required tools before pipeline execution

## Improvements

- **Documentation**: Expanded README with installation instructions, troubleshooting section, and advanced usage examples
- **Code Quality**: Better organization, type hints, and consistent error handling
- **Configuration**: More detailed documentation of configuration parameters
- **Performance**: Optimized code for better efficiency

## Technical Details

- Added trap commands for better error handling in shell scripts
- Improved file parsing with robust error handling
- Enhanced visualization of sgRNA characteristics with matplotlib
- Standardized logging format across all components
- Created utility functions for common tasks (file loading, sequence manipulation, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bakerwm/identify_sgRNA_on_IgH.git
cd identify_sgRNA_on_IgH

# Checkout version 1.1
git checkout v1.1

# Set up the conda environment
conda env create -f find_sgrna.yml
conda activate find_sgrna
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline
bash workflow.sh config.sh
```

## Known Issues

- Report generation module is still under development and may not work correctly in all cases
- The sgRNA performance prediction feature is not yet implemented

## Coming Soon

- sgRNA performance prediction based on sequence features
- Integration with external CRISPR design tools
- Web interface for easier usage
